# CMMS - Campus Maintenance  Management System
## a brief introduction
This project is a very simple version of a database management system, regarding the maintenance tasks of a campus.

The system is connected with another formal database management system - MySQL. You can use your own MySQL account and password to login in the command line when running the "main" function. Then the program will set the database on your device as "root".

This system contains many functions, including assigning activities and offices, searching for certain employees and their information, etc.
